Algorithm for Simple Calculator Code

1. Initialize Main Loop:
   - Continuously prompt the user for input until the user chooses to exit.

2. Display Menu:
   - Print the options for the user:
     - 1. Addition
     - 2. Subtraction
     - 3. Multiplication
     - 4. Division
     - 5. Exit

3. Get User Choice:
   - Read the user input for operation choice.
   - If the choice is '5', print "Goodbye!" and exit the loop.
   - If the choice is not a valid option (1-4), print an error message and restart the loop.

4. Map Choice to Operation:
   - Assign the corresponding mathematical operation based on the user choice.

5. Input Validation:
   - Prompt the user to enter the first number.
     - If the input is invalid (not numeric), print an error message, clear the input stream, and restart the loop.
   - Prompt the user to enter the second number.
     - If the input is invalid (not numeric), print an error message, clear the input stream, and restart the loop.

6. Perform Calculation:
   - Call the calculate function with the two numbers and the selected operation.
   - Handle division by zero within the calculate function by printing an error message if it occurs.

7. Display Result:
   - If the operation is valid and no division by zero error occurs, print the result of the calculation.

8. Repeat:
   - Return to the main loop to allow the user to perform another calculation or exit.

This algorithm ensures that all user inputs are validated and appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid choices or inputs, making the calculator user-friendly and robust.
