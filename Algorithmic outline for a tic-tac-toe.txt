Algorithmic outline for a tic-tac-toe game:

1. Initialize Board and Players:
   - Create a 3x3 board to store game positions.
   - Set the initial player (commonly 'X').

2. Display Board:
   - Print the current state of the board to the screen.

3. Player Move:
   - Prompt the current player to enter their move (a position on the board).
   - Validate the move:
     - Ensure the position is within the valid range (1-9).
     - Check if the position is already occupied.
   - If valid, update the board with the player's symbol ('X' or 'O').

4. Check Win:
   - After each move, check if the current player has won:
     - Check all rows to see if all positions are occupied by the same player.
     - Check all columns for the same condition.
     - Check both diagonals for the same condition.

5. Check Draw:
   - If the board is full (all positions are occupied) and there is no winner, the game is a draw.

6. Switch Players:
   - Alternate between players after each valid move.

7. Game Loop:
   - Continuously loop through the player move, check win, and check draw steps until the game ends (either a win or a draw).
